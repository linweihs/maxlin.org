Recently I start to think about hosting my own blog, and I was considering hosting either on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).
The infrastructure services, tools supported behind AWS and Google Cloud are tremedous, its good to build an enterprise service on top of it, but for hosting just one blog ? looks overkill to me. 

Also, the price, fees are expensive, charged by flavor type per hour, everything should be calculated well here.

Other than that, [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) also provides web hosting service, but I want to have fully controll of everything. 

## Linode ! Simply Awesome

[Linode](https://www.linode.com/) is incredible simple to set up ! 
* You choose a flavor (cpu/mem/disk)
* Pick a OS image
* Boot up 
* Start working in terminal !

Of all above, the smallest flavor only cost $20/mo and its way enough for just hosting a blog.
The greatest part is command line, command line give me an advantage to automate everything easily. 

Linode also provides DNS service to hook up with your own domain.

### Montior

Linode provides basic system monitoring showing on web console, so one could easily track the performance overtime.

For example,

### Go ahead and give it a try !

Most of my time are spent on Linux Terminal (RHEL)  writing scripts, automation, system tuning, etc. 
So when I start using Linode, I already found it very comfortable using it. I can do all kinds of hack, tuning and automation to make it work.

Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it !
